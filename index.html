    <section class="aboutMe">
      <p>Hi! My name is Bradley Meyer and im brand new to coding but so far am pushing my boundaries and having lots of fun! I was born and raised in Cincinnati, OH and lived my whole life in West Chester! West Chester in the early 2000's wasnt quite a suburb yet and it wasnt completly rural so it was very uniqe community that only grew throughout the years! Graduated from Lakota East High School in 2016 and went on to spend a year at BGSU where my focus was in Biology. After hating that and going through some personal struggles I decided to move back home and transfered to the University of Cincinnati where I switched majors to Buissness Marketing! I struggled to find my footing and lost motivation and ended up fizzling out education for Buissness experience! went to Real Estate school and became a Realtor for a year and now ive spent the last two years in the title buisness! After taking time to look at my future in Real Estate and saw that my goals wouldnt be achomplished quickly enough I left my job and enrolled in a Full-Time bootcamp through OSU! Im dead set on my goals and want to give these next 12 weeks my all! In this course its me v.s. myself and if I put in the time and effort im hoping it leads me to a new career in Tech!
